# Database-Design-and-Comparison-Using-SQL-and-NoSQL
This project involved designing, developing, and querying a database using multiple Database Management Systems (DBMS), including Oracle and MongoDB, to compare relational (SQL) and NoSQL (document store) technologies. PostgreSQL could also be used as an alternative to Oracle, with solutions provided in PostgreSQL for relevant queries.
